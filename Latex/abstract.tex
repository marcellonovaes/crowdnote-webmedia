This paper introduces CrowdNote, a crowdsourcing environment for complex video annotations without the need for trained workers or specialists. CrowdNote is based on a cascading microtasks approach to achieve complex video annotation by aggregating and processing multiple simple annotations collected from the crowd. The used approach consists of dividing complex annotation tasks into simple and small microtasks, and cascading them to generate a final result. Moreover, this approach allows to use simple annotation tools rather than complex and expensive annotation systems, also it tends to avoid activities that may be tedious and time-consuming for contributors, that are the workers in crowdsourcing scenarios. The CrowdNote instance presented in this paper produces enriched videos in which all extra content added is provided, selected and positioned by the crowd. However, this software is open source and can be downloaded and used as template for different crowdsourcing applications based on video annotation.
