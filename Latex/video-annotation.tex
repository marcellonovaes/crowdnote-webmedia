Video annotation involves inserting tags on video objects to describe their content for later use. In addition to semantic annotations that help describe the context and content of the videos, also can be add annotations that describe characteristics of the media such as quality, coding among other propertie \cite{Naphade:2004:DSC:1027527.1027680,Wang:2009:BDM:1652990.1653002,4420087}. These annotations facilitate the manipulation of videos, allowing the creation of content-based distribution applications \cite{Zhang:2012:KIE:2339530.2339620}, indexing \cite{Zhang:2007:PRS:1290082.1290126,Fendri:2010:SIS:1743384.1743446}, summarization \cite{Ishino:2012:SVH:2457524.2457633,Fiao:2016:AGS:3001773.3001802}, navigation \cite{Goldman:2008}, composition \cite{Wilk:2014:MVB:2647868.2654857,Wilk:2015:VCC:2713168.2713178} among many others, both by automatic and manual means\cite{Wang:2011:ALM:1899412.1899414}.
